# Food-Dine-In-Ready
A graduate object oriented design project

## App Idea
The app FoodDine-inReady is very different than all the leading food-industry apps available in the market because as of now, each and every app on the market is just focusing on delivery. But our Web-App, focuses on the dine-in aspect of the food sector and provides the user with an elevated experience by cutting down on their wait time, as well as exertion by providing multiple features such as, finding and reserving available parking space near the venue. The vision of our app is to provide customers with the same peace of mind in dine-in as they experience in a delivery based scenario, thus working towards 100% customer satisfaction. The App also provides a Map view of the inside of the restaurant which makes it stand out among other such apps.

The target audience for this app is not limited to any age-group. Everyone from a high school student to an old couple can utilize this app equally and benefit the same. However considering the scope of the project, and its online nature, we believe that the majority of the user base will comprise of Millenials as that is the most tech-savvy sector from the user-base.
